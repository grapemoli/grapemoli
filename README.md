# Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @grapemoli, a Junior working towards a BS in Computer Science. The name is inspired by grapes and guacamoli. Both are great.

While I do have a preference for C++ and Python, I am confident that I understand the essence of programming in any language: the algorithm. With Google, testing around, and more Google, I believe that any language can be easily learned.

Relevant courses that I took are Data Structures and a myriad of math classes (Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics). Upcoming relevant courses this spring are Software Engineering courses and Database/Data Systems courses.
