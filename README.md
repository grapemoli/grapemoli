# Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grace Nguyen, a Junior working towards a BS in Computer Science. The name is inspired by grapes and guacamoli. Both are great.

While I do have a preference for C++ and Python, I am confident in my ability to pick up programming languages; after all, the essence of programming is the algorithm! Behind every project is a UML diagram and a whiteboard with psuedocode.

Relevant courses that I took are Data Structures and a myriad of math classes (Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics). Upcoming relevant courses this spring are Software Engineering courses and Database/Data Systems courses.
