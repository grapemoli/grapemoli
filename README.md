# Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi a Junior working towards a BS in Computer Science. The name is inspired by grapes and guacamoli. Both are great.

I have a preference for C++ and Java, but I've also dabbled in Python, JavaScript, and Swift. 

Relevant courses that I took are Data Structures, Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Client-Side Programming. Currently, I'm in a SWE and Oracle Database course.

# Projects of Interest
- Web-App Pokedex  {Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/PokeDex
This web application web-scraped off of Bulbapedia, and took information provided by the PokeAPI to create a multiple tables in SQLite. Using Bottle, a Python framework, I created a comprehensive encyclopedia of all Pokemon regions, pokemons, and gym leaders.
- MGOT (Plant-Care Simulation) {Java}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/MGOT
MGOT was created by web-scrapping plant information off of Tropicopia, and creating a textfiles of the plants seperated by plant categorization. This is one of my biggest projects, and is a realistic, comprehensive  simulator. Users can buy, nuture, grow, and possibly kill plants! Other points of interest is that I created a system that calculated logarithmic plant growth, which took into account the season and overall plant condition. 
- Tic-Tac-Toe {Python}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/Tic-Tac-Toe
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game made in Python. Technically my first 'official' game.
- N-Queens {C++}
- https://github.com/grapemoli/NQueens
Given a n-by-n sized chessboard, I use the stack to calculate a chess-board of queens where no queen is in immediate reach of one another. 
- Horse Race in Swift {Swift}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/horseRaceSwift
I simulate a horserace between multiple horses by using a random number generator. The track is represented literally, with each period representing a unit distance. and a number representing the horse. 
- Horse Race in Visual Basic {VB.NET}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/horseRaceVB
The same alogrithm as the Horse Race in Swift, but this time I do it in Visual Basic (depricated language). 
- Hashing Spell Checker {C++}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/spellChecker
Using the chaining hash table technique, I created a spell checker that takes a user input and recommends the closest word match. 
- Missing Number {Scala}
  - https://github.com/grapemoli/missingNumber
This was my first attempt at the functional programming paradigm, and it was difficult!
